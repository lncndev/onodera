# Onodera Docs
Welcome to Onodera's official documentation!



## Rules

#### No spam or otherwise low quality content
Spam or content that is "bottom of the barrel" in terms of quality, will be removed. Repeat offense could result in more serious action.

#### Do not use the API to populate your own database
It's quite resource intensive to give an archive of everything in our database to anyone that asks for it. Please use our JSON dataset instead (auto-generated every hour.)



## Privacy
We value privacy and you probably do too. Onodera will never sell your data and we will always be as transparent as possible about what we collect and what we do with it.

### What we collect and why
 - Email
   - Collected to facilitate authentication
 - IP Address
   - Collected to facilitate IP banning and combat spam
 - Anything else you give us, such as:
   - Your rating for a given entry
   - Your favorites
   - Posts



## API
#### Coming soon
