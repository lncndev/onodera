# Onodera Docs
Welcome to Onodera's official documentation!



## Rules

#### No spam or otherwise low quality content
Spam or content that is "bottom of the barrel" in terms of quality, will be removed. Repeat offense could result in more serious action.

#### Do not use the API to populate your own database
It's quite resource intensive to give an archive of everything in our database to anyone that asks for it. Please use our YAML dataset ([here](/data.yaml)) instead (auto-generated every hour.)



## Privacy
We value privacy and you probably do too. Onodera will never sell your data and we will always be as transparent as possible about what we collect and what we do with it.

### What we collect and why
 - Email
   - Collected to facilitate authentication
 - IP Address
   - Collected to facilitate IP banning and combat spam
 - Anything else you give us, such as:
   - Your rating for a given entry
   - Your favorites
   - Posts



## API
#### Coming soon



## FAQ

### Where is Onodera's data sourced from?
As of now, Onodera sources the majority of its data from the builtin MAL scraper (and torrent data from the Nyaa API lib.) In the future, Onodera hopes to source more of its data from its users.

### What fonts does Onodera use?
Sacramento and Trueno Regular

### Can I host Onodera myself?
Yes, but we don't recommend it. Please refer to the Readme for instructions.

### Will Onodera always be free?
Short answer: yes, long answer: no
Onodera will remain free, but extra functionality will be made available in the future that will be exclusive to donators as a token of thanks for supporting the project. All base functionality will remain free (and ad-free) forever.

### Will Onodera always be open source?
Yes, Onodera will remain AGPLv3 software (including paid features) forever.



## Uruka disclaimer
Onodera does not host any torrents, nor does it promote piracy. Please buy from legitimate sources to support the industry. **Use Onodera's Uruka features at your own risk!**
