# Why I made Onodera
I made Onodera because I love anime and, well, the anime community deserves better than MAL. Onodera aims to replace MAL with a fast, open source alternative written in Crystal.

# Who is Aki?
Aki is the Onodera mascot, with the name and personality of Shino Aki from Bokutachi no Remake. She loves to draw (and write Crystal of course.)
